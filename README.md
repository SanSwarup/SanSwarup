### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Swarup ,from Odisha,India. Currently I'm persuing my Bachelors degree in Computer Application(BCA). I'm a quiet optimistic, practical and thoughtful person and a quick learner and observer. My hobbies are singing, reading novels, writing poems and short stories. I have started coding in JAVA in 12th standard, although I was not that much frequent at that time. Then again I started coding during graduation. I'm good at handeling Adobe photoshop, Adobe lightroom and Adobe After effect. I love animation and editing photos and videos.
