### NAMASTE🙏,I'm Swarup
#### Developer| Singer
I'm from Odisha, India. I'm a student. Currently I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Application (MCA). I'm a quite optimistic, practical and thoughtful person and a quick learner and observer. I believe in teamwork. My hobbies are singing, reading novels, writing poems and short stories. I have started coding in JAVA in 12th standard, although I was not that much frequent at that time. Then again, I started coding during graduation. I'm good at handling Adobe photoshop, Adobe lightroom and Adobe After effect. I love animation and editing photos and videos. Currently learning guitar.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS /JAVA / Problem Solving.
